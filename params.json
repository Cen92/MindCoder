You can write some code on an Android device, interpret and evaluate this code using ANTLR and send an output to a Mindstorm v2.0 to run. \r\n\r\n###Project Blog\r\nFollow the development of this project at [MindCoderApp](http://mindcoderapp.wordpress.com/)\r\n\r\nThe functions are as follows\r\n```\r\nmoveForward(int distance)\r\nmoveBackward(int distance)\r\nturnLeft(int degrees)\r\nturnRight(int degrees)\r\nshoot(int numberOfShots)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe language is modeled on a set of ANTLR tutorials from [here](http://bkiers.blogspot.ie/))\r\nAll other code has been written by @Cen92\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
